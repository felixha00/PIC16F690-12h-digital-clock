# PIC16F690-12h-digital-clock
`COMPLETED ON 24/05/2018`   
  
A very simple 24h Digital Clock programmed in Assembly on a PIC16F690. Unfortunately I don't have the circuit diagram anymore.  
* Features a reset switch that sets the clock back to 00 00  
* An AM/PM indicator was planned to be implemented but was not. An alternate idea was to change it to 24h instead.
