A very simple 12h Digital Clock programmed in Assembly on a PIC16F690. Unfortunately I don't have the circuit diagram anymore so this is just a reference repository.  
* Features a reset switch that sets the clock back to 00 00  
* Programmed in MPLAB IDE, flashed with ATMEL FLIP DFU  
* An AM/PM indicator was planned to be implemented but was not. An alternate idea was to change it to 24h instead.
